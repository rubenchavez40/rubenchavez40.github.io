  The Students Records Editor is a C program that allows the user to view and edit a set of data which are student records. This data is stored in a separate file titled students.data. Running this program, it immediately displays all the student records and allows any fields of the records to be modified. However, for modification, the program ensures only the fields the user specifies they want to change will be edited.  

  Some fields that can be edited include first and last name, age, and GPA. I also included thorough error checking specifically for the program's student record formatting. This program demonstrated coding flexibility and modularity giving users a wide variety of possibile changes, and the base code provided in my repository allows for easy addition or adaptation to more/different fields for potentially different kinds of records. This code showcased my skilla in file I/O operations in C, along with proper and strong error handling.
