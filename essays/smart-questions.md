## Think before you speak

A common phrase I got a few too many times growing up was "think before you speak next time". It's a good motto to remember in general, but especially applicable for the concept of asking questions the "smart way". Now in the world of software engineering it's a bit more complex than just thinking for a few biref moments before saying something outloud, but the same general principle applies. What you say matters, and you want to get the most bang for your buck when you ask anything in a complicated and highly technical field. Every new piece of information, help, and guidance is ever so crucial. So how do we get the most out of our questions?   

## Getting good ROQ (return on question) 

You like that double entendre? Get it, "return" and the ROI reference? Eh? Anyway, a good place to look how other software engineers are asking their questions is on the site 'Stack Overflow". Although it is clear that not all questions are equal, there are several key aspects of what makes a question worth your precious time of typing away. In the following example, we can observe the makings of a quesiton asked the "smart way". Below, we can see a user on Stack Overflow asking how to convert a string to boolean in JavaScript.

```
Q: How can I convert a string to boolean in JavaScript?

Can I convert a string representing a boolean value (e.g., 'true', 'false') into an intrinsic type in JavaScript?

I have a hidden form in HTML that is updated based on a user's selection within a list. This form contains some fields which represent boolean values and are dynamically populated with an intrinsic boolean value. However, once this value is placed into the hidden input field it becomes a string.

The only way I could find to determine the field's boolean value, once it was converted into a string, was to depend upon the literal value of its string representation.

var myValue = document.myForm.IS_TRUE.value;
var isTrueSet = myValue == 'true';
Is there a better way to accomplish this?
```
Going through a quick checklist, first, the heading of the question is clear and specific to the subject of the question. It's tagged in the proper categories such as "javascript", "boolean-operations", and "string-conversion" which all directly correlate to the question. Not only did the user give a concise and straightforward question, they also gave context to their situation/project and even shows an example of what they've tried and described the result they got in an attempt to find a better method of choice. Lastly, the user could've shown more courtesy in their original question or in the replies to help encourage community answers, but that's on the nitpickier side of things.

## For there to be good, there must be bad.

Like I mentioned earlier, not all questions are created equal. Not so "smart" questions can be labeled as such for a variety of factors. Obviously, anything to the opposite effect of what was mentioned in the "smart" question would be some telltale signs. However, this next question presents an entirely new set of issues that may cause an unintended and frankly unwanted answer that make the question itself... questionable. Ha ha... ha... ha?

Q: Facebook Desktop Notifier

I am a beginner programmer that have never used anything other than what's included in a language.

I am trying to create a desktop application that notifies me anytime I get an update onfacebook. 
How should go about doing this? Thanks in advance.

edit Sorry I was not clear. Is there any way to make a DESKTOP application with facebook
```

A simple “yes” would have answered the question, but we know that’s not the sort of answer he or she is looking for. Fortunately, someone kindly responded with a link to Facebook’s developer website. The asker should have done more research on his or her potential project. Then further down the road, he or she could have asked more specific and detailed questions that wouldn’t require a thousand-paged response for a sufficient answer.

## Conclusion

When we rely on others’ generosity and expertise to provide answers to our questions, it should hold that the question we ask should be one that leads to efficient and effective help that not only benefits us, but also the people we ask and others who might ask the same question in the future. Thus, if you have a question… make it a smart one! Asking questions may not always get you the best answer, but asking them in a way that will make others want to answer them will increase the success of finding a good solution and make it a positive experience on all sides.
