*Coding standards: the social contract of programming*

Coding standards are noticeably similar to the philosophical concept of a social contract. An entity creates rules and regulations for a specific community that serve numerous purposes like reducing confusion by maintaining order, or safety. Coding standards in specific help polish and tidy up code to establish consistency in building programs and assist other programmers in reading or reusing code. These standards span from smaller instances like camelCase vs PascalCase to more intense instances such as NASA forbidding recursion and function pointers because of potentially catastrophic errors. Recently, coding standards have been shifted toward the forefront of my programming priorities and after subjecting myself to this newly placed emphasis I've improved my code readability and established more uniformity in my programming.

## The ESLint Experience

To provide context, this was my first time using ESLint in VSCode and I was completely unaware of its existence until a little less than a week ago. My first impression before ever using it was, "Wow this is going to be so useful I'll be able to spot errors faster now!" After completing my first project using ESLint, my opinion changed to, "this is a pain in the ***." It was frustrating dealing with ESLint's pickiness and lack of finding actual "errors." However, once I had finished my first project and got used to ESLintâ€™s stinginess, something changed when I began my second project. I noticed I was naturally trying to code using ESLint's standards instead of doing my typical typing away hoping to fix up any readability or inefficiency/logic concerns later. This was the first time I had taken more consideration into following a coding standard outside of camelCase and generally trying to make my code look somewhat formatted. That was neat.

## Takeaways from ESLint

It feels most suiting to reduce my summary of ESLint to a simple comparison. ESLint is the MLA of coding; yes, some people might find it redundant and unnecessarily time-consuming, but you cannot deny that it establishes consistency and eliminates potential uncertainty when collaborating. In a properly MLA-formatted paper, you know what you're getting before even reading it. You know what the sources are and where to find them, you know how the paragraph structure is going to look, etc. From a writer's perspective, you can create a routine for how to write and this can make the writing process smoother with more repetitions. From a collaboration standpoint, MLA format assists in comprehending what you're reading and being able to properly conduct your own background research on the topic or even make edits and additions without either destructing the original format, or hoping that your revisions fit the format of the original author by educated guess. There are preset guidelines to follow that anyone can fit their creations and modifications in. This same concept applies to ESLint, some of the "unnecessary" rules help maintain a methodical structure for the community's benefit.

## Final Output

ESLint and coding standards are the act of making your bed in the morning. Do you need to do it? No, but it keeps your routine organized and builds a good habit. Some coding standards are trivial, but even the trivial ones are necessary to account for the entire rulebook. With one week of ESLint under my belt, I'll say that there are some growing pains to being a goody-two-shoes coder, but the payoff of developing as a programmer was well worth mumbling a couple curse words.
