Software engineering is not for the faint of heart or brain power. It requires dynamic and critical thinking skills, the ability to grasp concepts quickly, and risking your eyesight if you choose to spend countless hours on programming without blue-light glasses. Not trying to make this essay sound more like an advertisement, but seriously, they're a great investment. When I first heard of this general briefing about entering the field, I was intimidated. However, I met a reality of my situation and the life that lies ahead of me. Either choose to pursue something that'll be incredibly time-consuming, mentally taxing, and overall simply a lot of hard work, or something a lot easier with the catch that a less-than-ideal future financial situation awaits. I chose the first option, although the choice as to what "hard" major I'd study in to start this journey was a whole other process in itself. 

## Why Software Engineering?
To keep things brief, I've always enjoyed looking at data. What I'd do with this data, you may ask? The process was simple: comprehend it, sort it, and use it to gain a certain advantage or gain a better understanding of some overarching subject. For example, during the NFL offseason, as a big fan of the sport (how 'bout 'dem Cowboys), I enjoy playing fantasy football. To try not to get too into this and totally throw off any readers who have no idea what I'm talking about, I'm not going to dive into the specifics of my process. In more general terms, I would take an entire season's worth of important stats, contextualize them based on certain out-of-ordinary circumstances or outliers, highlight certain players that were being undervalued or overvalued by public perception, and use my own personal analysis to give me a leg up in my fantasy football leagues. Yes, that is a completely unnecessary and arguably time-wasting activity, especially considering there are professionals who do this kind of stuff for free, but I had fun doing it. It helps that it was in a subject of interest, but actually making these spreadsheets and creating formulas never felt like I was doing any work. It was for my own entertainment.

## Growing Interests
Now in the present day, I am a 3rd-year computer science major at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, and although I still enjoy manipulating football statistics for fantasy football, I now have newer interests that I have gained in my experience here so far. I enjoy programming applications relating to real-life subjects that require lots of strategy. Something that assists or even provides a strategy to help the user's chances. Computing the odds, processing it, and giving the user important information of note or the best move to make. I've noticed this is quite similar to what I was doing for myself in the fantasy football example. Maybe it's not really a new interest, but more of an expanding one. My favorite project I worked on that relates to this interest was when I programmed a poker-betting strategist that would tell the user how much to bet given their circumstances. I got the inspiration for this project largely due to the fact that I'm not much of a mental math person. I prefer to see what I'm dealing with (poker pun unintended), whether it be drawing it out myself or manipulating the information into a more digestible format. Coincidentally, that's exactly what I've enjoyed accomplishing the most in my software-developing experience.

## To Infinity and Beyond
Moving forward, my main focus is to develop my software engineering skills to a point where I can confidently program or assist in programming real-life applications that provide guidance in people's lives when faced with challenging tasks or decisions. I know that is pretty broad, and if we're being completely honest, my dream job would be a programmer for a fantasy football company or the NFL itself, but I digress. Ultimately, I hope to continue along on my path and carve out a successful career of helping people in my future!
